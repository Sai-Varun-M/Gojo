## Project Description

**Satoru Gojo Cursed Techniques – Hand Gesture Controlled Visualizer**

This project is a **real-time hand gesture recognition and visual effects system** inspired by *Jujutsu Kaisen*. It uses a webcam to detect hand gestures and triggers different **Satoru Gojo cursed techniques** with cinematic particle effects and animations.

The system tracks hand movements using computer vision and maps specific gestures to techniques such as:

* Imaginary Technique: Purple
* Domain Expansion: Unlimited Void
* Reversal Technique: Red
* Domain Expansion: Malevolent Shrine

When a gesture is detected, dynamic 3D particle effects and UI animations are rendered in real time, creating an interactive anime-style experience.

## Features

* Real-time hand gesture recognition
* Webcam-based interaction
* Animated cursed technique effects
* Particle simulations and bloom effects
* Anime-inspired UI and visual design
* Smooth transitions between techniques

---

## Tech Stack

* JavaScript
* Three.js for 3D rendering
* MediaPipe Hands for gesture detection
* WebGL for real-time graphics
* HTML/CSS for UI

Your implementation uses MediaPipe to track hands and trigger visual effects dynamically based on gestures.

## How It Works

1. Webcam captures live video.
2. MediaPipe detects hand landmarks.
3. Gesture logic maps hand poses to techniques.
4. Three.js renders particle-based cursed techniques in real time.

## Use Cases

* Computer vision demos
* Interactive visual effects projects
* Anime-inspired UI experiments
* Real-time gesture-controlled interfaces

---

## Future Improvements

* More cursed techniques
* Gesture customization
* Sound effects and voice lines
* Performance optimization
